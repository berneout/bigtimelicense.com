      <p>
        Use of the software for the benefit of your company is use for a permitted purpose:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>

          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="how-to-request">
        How to Request
      </h2>
      <p>
        If this software includes an address in a standard place, such as in documentation, software package metadata, or an “about” page or screen, try to request a fair commercial license at that address. If this package includes both online and offline addresses, try online before offline. If you can’t deliver a request that way, or this software doesn’t include any addressees, spend one hour online researching an address, recording all your searches and inquiries as you go, and try any addresses that you find. If you can’t find any addresses, or if those addresses also fail, that counts as failure to offer a fair commercial license by the licensor.
      </p>
      <h2 id="fair-use">
        Fair Use

        If you make any written claim that the software infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on behalf of your company.
      </p>
      <h2 id="violations">
        Violations
      </h2>
      <p>
        The first time you are notified in writing that you have violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless continue if you come into full compliance with these terms, and take practical steps to correct past violations, within 32 days of receiving notice. Otherwise, all your licenses end immediately.

      <h2 id="no-liability">
        No Liability
