      <h2 id="big-business">
        Big Business
      </h2>
      <p>
        You may use the software for the benefit of your company:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            for 128 days after your company stops qualifying under <a href="#small-business">Small Business</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            indefinitely, if the licensor or their legal successor does not offer fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory terms for a commercial license for the software within 32 days of <a href="#how-to-request">written request</a> and negotiate in good faith to conclude a deal
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="how-to-request">
        How to Request
      </h2>
      <p>
        If this software includes an address for the licensor or an agent of the licensor in a standard place, such as in documentation, software package metadata, or an “about” page or screen, try to request a fair commercial license at that address. If this package includes both online and offline addresses, try online before offline. If you can’t deliver a request that way, or this software doesn’t include any addressees, spend one hour online researching an address, recording all your searches and inquiries as you go, and try any addresses that you find. If you can’t find any addresses, or if those addresses also fail, that counts as failure to offer a fair commercial license by the licensor under <a href="#big-business">Big Business</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="fair-reasonable-and-nondiscriminatory-terms">
        Fair, Reasonable, and Nondiscriminatory Terms
      </h2>
      <p>
        Fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory terms may license the software perpetually or for a term, and may or may not cover new versions of the software. If the licensor advertises license terms and a pricing structure for generally available commercial licenses, the licensor proposes license terms and a price as advertised, and a customer not affiliated with the licensor has bought a commercial commercial license for the software on substantially equivalent terms in the past year, the proposal is fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory.
      </p>
      <h2 id="copyright-license">
        Copyright License
      </h2>
      <p>
        The licensor grants you a copyright license to do everything with the software that would otherwise infringe the licensor’s copyright in it for any purpose allowed by these terms.
      </p>
      <h2 id="notices">
        Notices
      </h2>
      <p>
        You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the URL for them above, as well as copies of any plain-text lines beginning with <code>Required Notice:</code> that the licensor provided with the software. For example:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Required Notice: Copyright Yoyodyne, Inc. (http://example.com)
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2 id="patent-license">
        Patent License
      </h2>
      <p>
        The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able to license, that you would infringe by using the software.
      </p>
      <h2 id="fair-use">
        Fair Use
      </h2>
      <p>
        You may have “fair use” rights for the software under the law. These terms do not limit them.
      </p>
      <h2 id="no-other-rights">
        No Other Rights
      </h2>
      <p>
        These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else. These terms do not imply any other licenses.
      </p>
      <h2 id="patent-defense">
        Patent Defense
      </h2>
      <p>
        If you make any written claim that the software infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on behalf of your company.
      </p>
      <h2 id="violations">
        Violations
      </h2>
      <p>
        The first time you are notified in writing that you have violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless continue if you come into full compliance with these terms, and take practical steps to correct past violations, within 32 days of receiving notice. Otherwise, all your licenses end immediately.
      </p>
      <h2 id="no-liability">
        No Liability
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong><em>As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.</em></strong>
      </p>
